Two different aproaches for making a ring UI element that can be used to show the curent HP of the player and similar things.

The first aproach is one that I saw a few times on the internet. People using an angle gradient for a cutout shader and manipulating that to cut away parts of the texture.
One of the biggest flaws of this is that imported gradient textures tend to make the cutout look really ugly because they use pixels.
Instead I tried the approach with an angle gradient made from the uv coordinates.
Since everything is mathematically calculated when working with uvs they will always look sharp.

The second approach is one that I wrote before I took a look at uv gradient manipulation.
This one uses a texture which is split in a white and a black side in the middle (or in this case a rounded gradient).
This halving gets rotated by a value between 0 and 1 to make a full turn.
By using this and mutliplying it to an unrotated one it is possible to make an alpha for angles up to 180°.
After 180° the unrotated one will instead be used to cut of the completed side so that the rotated one can be used for the remaining half.
This approach is probably more expensive then the first one because it has more to calculate and also uses an "if".

Both of theese can be easily made in Unreal Engine 4 as well (first one needs a custom node for the angle gradient though) so if someone has interest in the Material Tree feel free to drop me a message. :>
